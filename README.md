Rock–Paper–Scissors Game
This is a small game I built using Python’s Tkinter library. It’s the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors, but with a simple user interface. You can choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random choice. The game shows both choices on the screen, compares them, and then displays whether you win, lose, or draw.
I also added some extras to make it more fun:
Images for the moves (instead of just text).
A background image on the main screen.
A message that asks if you want to play again after each round.
It’s a straightforward project, but it was a nice way to practice event handling, working with canvases, and updating the interface in Tkinter.
